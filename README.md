# audio-digits-classification-using-MFCC-and-convolutional-neural-network

<h3>This project is delivered as part of my Masters in Big Data Science (MSc BDS) Program Module named “Machine Learning” in Queen Mary University of London (QMUL), London, United Kingdom.</h3> 

<h3>The project cover the basic solution and the Advanced Solution as given below based on Audio Feature Extraction Method named "Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC)" and Deep Learning Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).</h3>   

<h3>*Basic Solution:* Includes designing, building, training, validation and testing a model created to recognise numerals from 0 to 9 in the audio files.</h3>   

<h3><b>Advanced Solution:</b> Includes implementing the solution to predict the numeral based on a new audio test file. This model's solution can be applied to a Banking Application/Product and can be used for predicting a 4-digit passcode said by an authorised customer during on-call verification as part of login process to Internet Banking Account.</h3>   

<h3>NOTE: Due to the data privacy and the data protection policy to be adhered by the students; the datasets and the solution related code are not exposed and updated in the GitHub public profile; in order to be compliant with the Queen Mary University of London (QMUL) policies.</h3>
