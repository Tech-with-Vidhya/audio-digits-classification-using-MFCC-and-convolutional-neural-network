# audio-digits-classification-using-MFCC-and-convolutional-neural-network

This project is delivered as part of my Masters in Big Data Science (MSc BDS) Program Module named “Machine Learning” in Queen Mary University of London (QMUL), London, United Kingdom.  

The project cover the basic solution and the Advanced Solution as given below based on Audio Feature Extraction Method named "Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC)" and Deep Learning Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).  

Basic Solution:  Includes designing, building, training, validation and testing a model created to recognise numerals from 0 to 9 in the audio files.  

Advanced Solution: Includes implementing the solution to predict the numeral based on a new audio test file. This model's solution can be applied to a Banking Application/Product and can be used for predicting a 4-digit passcode said by an authorised customer during on-call verification as part of login process to Internet Banking Account.  

NOTE: Due to the data privacy and the data protection policy to be adhered by the students; the datasets and the solution related code are not exposed and updated in the GitHub public profile; in order to be compliant with the Queen Mary University of London (QMUL) policies.
